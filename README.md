Python: Fetch Data from Craigslist

### INTRO >
This is a personal project where I am working with python to scrap data from CraigsList site.
CraigsList is a site used to create ads to sell, buy, exchange or rent your personal things.
URL: https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites

### DETAILS >
I had a special need to search for an apartment to rent. And I wanted to be able to grab the data to filter and analyse on an MS Excel file. So I created the script to be able to grab this data.
This is a local script to run on your computer.

### ** WARNING **
All my development and tests were made on static HTML files on my local drive to avoid any overload of requests to CraigList servers.

### PHASE 2 (still under study and dev) >
After having the script that fetchs the data, I am starting to investigate how to use Google API to identify other points of interest and the reverse address of the apartment based on the Latitude and Longitude.
